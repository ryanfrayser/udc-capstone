# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project utilizes asynchronous Vanilla JS, Node JS/Express, and the Open Weather API to allow a user to enter their ZIP and feeling about the day and record that data dynamically on the page.


This uses Udacity Starter code, and is hosted on Github Pages.
